    <p>
      <strong>The cat <em>(Felis catus)</em> </strong> , also referred to as
      <strong>domestic cat</strong> or <strong>house cat</strong> , is a small
      domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of
      the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that
      the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It
      is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a
      feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and
      its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to
      killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body,
      quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell
      are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
      crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like
      meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat
      body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
      human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives
      pheromones. Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late
      autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions,
      with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats
      are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known
      as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying
      and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
      resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
      extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species. As of 2017, the domestic
      cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6
      million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one
      cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated
      population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an
      estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[49] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.[50] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).[29]</p>
    <h3>Skeleton</h3>
    <p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).[51]: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.[51]: 16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.[52]</p>
    <h3>Skull</h3>
    <p>The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.[53]: 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.[54] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.[54]

The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.[53]: 37  Cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless, they are subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.[55]</p>
    <h3>Claws</h3>
    <p>Cats have protractible and retractable claws.[56] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet.[57] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.[58]

Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits ("polydactyly").[59] Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and in Great Britain.[60]</p>
    <h3>Ambulation</h3>
    <p>The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.[61] Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.[62]</p>
